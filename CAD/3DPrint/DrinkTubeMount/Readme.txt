Drink tube mount designs.
v0.1 is very experimental! No results guaranteed!

Designs optimized for 3D printing.
Use FDM, with 0.4mm nozzle (e.g. Ultimaker 2+)

The mount holds a 15Ga hypodermic drink tube in place by press fit. 
The DirectContact version presses a 22ga wire onto the tube.
The FieldCoupling version places the wire adjacent to the tube with an insulating layer of plastic blocking current flow.
The mounts have a socket for a captured 4-40 nut, McMaster Part# 90730A005
